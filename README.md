Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using deep learning techniques, specifically applied to Google’s stock price dataset. Stock (or equity) represents partial ownership of a corporation, entitling shareholders to a portion of the company’s profits. Stock prices fluctuate daily due to market forces—primarily supply and demand. While predicting stock movements is complex and often uncertain, this project explores how historical data and machine learning can be used to identify trends.

This project explores the use of technical analysis through machine learning and deep learning to predict stock prices. Specifically, we apply LSTM-based models to identify and forecast patterns in Google stock prices over time.
Problem Statement:
Stock market analysis can be broadly classified into:
- Fundamental Analysis: Focused on company performance and external market factors.
- Technical Analysis: Based on historical prices, trends, and statistical indicators.
Implementation Workflow
